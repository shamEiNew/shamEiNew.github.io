 
 Existence of noncommutative rings.

<blockquote><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> If the additive group of ring is cyclic then the ring is commutative. </em></blockquote></p>

<p>

 <em>Proof:</em>  Let r be the generator of the group and let a, b be the elements of R then there exist $latex {m, n \in \mathbb{Z}}&fg=000000$ such that a = mr, b = nr. <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle ab=(mn)r^2=ba&fg=000000$

    $latex \Box&fg=000000$

<blockquote><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> If R is a finite ring of order $latex {n &gt; 1}&fg=000000$ and if n has square free factorisation, then R is commutative ring. </em></blockquote>
</p>

<p>

 <em>Proof:</em>  The proof is implication of the above lemma and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. As R is a finite additive group with no square factors, this implies that it can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order but since it is square free the decomposition is itself cyclic (as the orders will be coprime) which implies that R is commutative. $latex \Box&fg=000000$

<blockquote><b>Theorem 3</b> <em> If p is prime integer, then there exist a noncommutative ring of order $latex {p^2}&fg=000000$. </em></blockquote>
</p>

<p>

 <em>Proof:</em>  Let R be the direct product of cyclic group of order p, say $latex {C_p}&fg=000000$ with itself. Therefore, R has order $latex {p^2}&fg=000000$ and it is abelian but note that R is not cyclic, infact it is generated by two elements $latex {\{(c, 0), (0, c)\}}&fg=000000$ where c is the generator of $latex {C_p}&fg=000000$ and has order p. We define multiplication as follows for all elements in R which are of the form $latex {(m_ic, n_ic)}&fg=000000$ for some $latex {m_i, n_i \in \mathbb{Z}}&fg=000000$ <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle (m_1c, n_1c)\cdot(m_2c, n_2c) = (m_2 + n_2)(m_1c, n_1c)&fg=000000$</p>
 It is well defined as the right side clearly lies in R. Associative and distributive laws follow from the structure of group $latex {C_p}&fg=000000$ and clearly the ring is not commutative, as $latex {(c, 0)(0, c)=(c, 0)\neq (0, c) =(0, c)(c, 0)}&fg=000000$. $latex \Box&fg=000000$

<blockquote><b>Theorem 4</b> <em> For any any n and a prime p, there exist a noncommutative ring of order $latex {np^2}&fg=000000$. </em></blockquote>
</p>

<p>

 <em>Proof:</em>  Define R as the direct sum of any ring of order n and the ring of order $latex {p^2}&fg=000000$ as constructed above. This is noncommutative ring of order $latex {np^2}&fg=000000$ as it contains subring of order $latex {p^2}&fg=000000$ which is noncommutative. $latex \Box&fg=000000$

<p>
Finally summing all the results we have the following result:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><b>Theorem 5</b> <em> For $latex {m&gt;1}&fg=000000$, there exists a noncommutative ring of order m iff m has square factors. </em></blockquote>
</p>

<p>

 <em>Proof:</em>  If m has square factors then we can construct rings as above. And for the other side use contrapositive of theorem 2. $latex \Box&fg=000000$
